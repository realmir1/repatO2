# Respiration Rate Analysis Program ðŸš€

This C++ program analyzes respiration rate based on user input. Monitoring respiration rate can be a critical indicator of health status, and this program is particularly useful in medical analysis and biomedical engineering applications.
<br>




## Features 

- **Respiration Rate Calculation:** The program takes user input (e.g., number of breaths taken in one minute) and calculates the respiration rate.
- **Results Evaluation:** The calculated respiration rate is evaluated to determine whether it falls within the normal range for a healthy individual.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The program is designed to be simple to use, allowing users to quickly input data and receive results.
- **Health Categorization:** Based on the calculated respiration rate, the program classifies the result into various categories to provide users with feedback on their health status.
<br>
## Usage

1. **Compiling the Program:**
   - To compile your C++ program, you will need a C++ compiler. For example, you can compile the program using g++ with the following command:
   
     ```bash
     g++ main.cpp -o respiration_rate
     ```

2. **Running the Program:**
   - After compiling, run the program by executing the following command:
   
     ```bash
     ./respiration_rate
     ```

3. **Input:**
   - The program will prompt you to enter data, such as the number of breaths taken in a minute. This input is used to calculate your respiration rate.
   
4. **Output:**
   - After entering the required data, the program will display your respiration rate along with a health categorization ( Normal, Tachypnea, Bradypnea) based on the result.

## Requirements ðŸ’»

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang)
- Standard C++ library (included with most compilers)
